# 10. Quality Requirements

## 10.1. Quality Tree

<div class="formalpara-title">

![Hierarchy of building blocks](images/09_Quality_tree.png)

</div>

## 10.2. Quality Scenarios

<div class="formalpara-title">

**[Usability](#Usability)**

</div>

Scenario 1: A new user attempts to register and create a profile.

The user has instaled the app and opened it for the first time. When the user navigates to the registration screen, the registration process should be easily understandable and the user should complete the registration process without assistance.

Scenario 2: A user explores subscription options.

An existing user is interested in premium features. When the user navigates to the subscription information section, the subscription options should be clearly presented.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**[Reliability](#Reliability)**

</div>

Scenario 1: Handling high concurrent user load.

A significant number of users are accessing the app simultaneously. When users are uploading, editing, and sharing images, the app should function smoothly without crashing or significant lag.

Scenario 2: Recovering from a server failure.

One of the servers hosting the app fails. The failure occurs during peak usage hours. Then the system should automatically reroute traffic to other servers, ensuring uninterrupted service for users.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**[Performance](#Performance)**

</div>

Scenario 1: Image upload and retrieval speed.

A user selects a high-resolution image to upload. When the user uploads the image, it should be uploaded and available for viewing in a reasonable amount of time.

Scenario 2: Response time during peak usage.

The app is experiencing peak traffic. When a user performs an action requiring server response, the action should complete within a few seconds, even under high load.

<!-- A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by
priority

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Motivation**

</div>

âRisk management is project management for grown-upsâ (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

<div class="formalpara-title">

**Form**

</div>

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested
measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.

See [Risks and Technical Debt](https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/) in
the arc42 documentation.
